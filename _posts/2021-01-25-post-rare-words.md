In the work "Continuous Learning in ["Neural Machine Translation using Bilingual Dictionaries"]() we analysed the ability of NMT systems to translate rare terms and presented techniques to improve their ability to translate morphological variants.
The propsed methods is based on creating a new test set using a different split of the training and test data concentrating on these terms. You can easily work on the proposed testset by downloading the newly created ["splits of the data set"](https://osf.io/zj42x/) or split other copora in the same way using the provided [code](https://github.com/nlp-dke/rareWordNMT).
