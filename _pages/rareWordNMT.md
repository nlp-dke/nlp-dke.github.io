title: "Rare words in Neural machine translation"
---


In the work "Continuous Learning in ["Neural Machine Translation using Bilingual Dictionaries"]() we analysed the ability of NMT systems to translate rare terms and presented techniques to improve their ability to translate morphological variants.The propsed methods is based on creating a new test set using a different split of the training and test data concentrating on these terms. 

## Ready-to-use-dataset

In the paper we splited the following data sets. The splits from the paper can be downloaded [here](https://osf.io/zj42x/)

  * TED Enlish-German
  * Europarl English-German
  * Europarl English-Czech
  
## Own data sets

You can split your own data sets with the same methods using the code in the [github repository](https://github.com/nlp-dke/rareWordNMT)

## Publication

All details of the methods you can find in the publication:
